# Task Monitoring Using Airflow

* Apache Airflow provides built-in features for monitoring workflows and tasks, which can help teams identify and resolve issues quickly. Some of the key monitoring features provided by Airflow include:

* Task logs: Airflow logs all task runs and stores them in a database or an object store. Teams can use these logs to troubleshoot issues and monitor task progress.

* Task statistics: Airflow provides task statistics, such as the number of tasks completed, the number of tasks failed, and the duration of tasks. Teams can use these statistics to monitor the performance of workflows and tasks.

* Alerting: Airflow can send alerts to teams when tasks fail or when specific events occur. Teams can configure alerting rules based on their needs, such as sending an email or a Slack message.

* SLA monitoring: Airflow can monitor SLAs (Service Level Agreements) for workflows and tasks, ensuring that tasks are completed within a specified timeframe.

* Visualization: Airflow provides a web-based UI that allows teams to visualize workflows and task dependencies. Teams can use this UI to monitor the progress of workflows and identify issues quickly.

* Metrics collection: Airflow can collect metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage for workflows and tasks. Teams can use these metrics to monitor resource usage and optimize workflows for better performance.

## By leveraging these monitoring features provided by Airflow, teams can ensure that their workflows are running smoothly and that any issues are quickly identified and resolved. This can help improve the reliability of workflows and reduce downtime, resulting in better productivity and cost savings.

You can also monitor task instance.

** In Apache Airflow, a task instance represents a specific instance of a task that is executed as part of a workflow. 
A task instance is created when a task is scheduled to run and contains information such as the task ID, 
the execution date, the task state (e.g. running, success, or failure), and any parameters or inputs required for the task.

** When a task is executed, Airflow creates a new task instance for that execution. 
Each task instance is associated with a unique execution date, allowing multiple instances of the same 
task to be run at different times.

** Task instances also provide visibility into the status of each task and allow teams to monitor the progress of workflows. 
Teams can use the Airflow web UI to view the state of each task instance, check for errors, and troubleshoot issues.

** Overall, task instances are a critical component of Airflowâ€™s workflow management system, 
providing the information and tracking necessary to ensure that tasks are executed correctly and efficiently.
