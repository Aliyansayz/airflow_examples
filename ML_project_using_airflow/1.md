Set Up Your Workspace

First things first, let’s familiarize ourselves with the tools and materials we’ll need for the project, including the programming environment and files for your web app.
Cloud IDE

Cloud IDE, offered by Skills Network labs, is a lab environment that allows you to put your programming skills to the test in a real-world setting. There are many benefits to using Cloud IDE, whether you’re developing an application or working with databases such as Airflow, MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, or Datasette. To make it easier for developers to adapt to the new environment, Cloud IDE is based on the familiar Visual Studio Code interface, reducing the learning curve.

Here’s a breakdown of the components:

Left Panel: You can access and follow the step-by-step instructions shown in this panel, just like in the this guided project, as shown in the screenshot below.

Right Panel: This is where you’ll get hands-on practice with your programming.

File Explorer: Like VS Code, you can create and access your files using the file explorer and make any edits you need in the Cloud IDE environment. You can find the file explorer in the screenshot below.

Terminal: This is where you can put the command lines.

Just a heads up, Cloud IDE doesn’t save any of your files at the moment. To avoid any issues, we strongly suggest you finish this lab in one go.
